# Palm Tree Beach
This my COMP3015 30% Submission in which we was tasked with loading in a custom model and using lighting techniques and more to build a scene. We had to use a project template to build upon.

## Visual Studio + Operating System
What I used to create this program:

Visual Studio version: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)
(Version 17.7.5)

Operating System version: Windows 10 Pro (Version 22H2)

## How My Program Works
My OpenGL C++ program utilizing the project template, GLAD, GLFW, and GLM libraries brings custom 3D models into the program. With phong lighting, multi-lighting, fog, and a textured plane allowing for a more finished looking product. And looking more like a foggy palm tree beach.

Using GLSL for handling vertex and fragment shading, these define how the geometry and textures are rendered with lighting calculations based on Phong shading.

My CPP file hands the rendering loop, this includes binding appropriate shaders, setting up uniforms, properties for the lighting, texturing objects and more.

The code is commented to allow for easier understanding

## How To Run
To run simply
- Place OpenGL folder into your C:Drive/Users/Public
- Next open BuildEXE and Run PalmTreeBeach.exe
